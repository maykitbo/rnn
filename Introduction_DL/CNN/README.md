**Homework**

[Sports balls - multiclass image classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/sports-balls-multiclass-image-classification)

The deadline for the school's merch contest is 23:59 next Sunday (28 January 2024).

The main limitation of the problem is NOT to use transfer learning on third-party pre-trained networks (such as Xception, EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.). It is possible to use your own built and pre-trained network.

It is desirable to comment the progress of solving the problem and build graphs of learning networks.

Keep the weights of your models and send them with the solution so that we don't waste our time training them.

At the output you should have the results of four metrics attached.
(Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1).

Send solutions to [Ivan](https://t.me/naconov) with [Alex](https://t.me/zamyrailov) in telegram (@naconov, @zamyrailov) with a link to the github with Jupiter Notebook + a link to Google Drive with the neural network weights file (if they do not fit in the repository by weight).
